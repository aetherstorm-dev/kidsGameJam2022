    m_Localized: It used to be smaller, but it was full of trees. It's larger now,
      but the old trees are gone, and no one wants to plant any.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 13301985800192
    m_Localized: I just tried to plant more, but my back hurts too much. I wish that
      this park could have trees again.

    m_Localized: Wow, that already looks so much better! There's a little left to
      do, though.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 37317404487680
    m_Localized: Oh, my... I remember when the park used to look like this. I'm glad
      you'll be able to see it when you're older. Thank you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38167237586944
    m_Localized: Thanks again for planting those trees! Can you imagine what this
      park will look like in ten years? I'm not sure they'll grow too tall with the
      river being so dirty, though.

      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: I wanna play outside with my neighbor, but my mom says I can't because
      it's too dirty outside.

    m_Localized: I haven't been feeling so good. I think it's because the water's
      been so gross.
